## Hi, I’m Spyros 👋

I’m a **video editor from Greece 🇬🇷** with a strong passion for storytelling through visuals.

Video editing is more than a skill for me — it’s something I genuinely enjoy and constantly work to improve. I care about pacing, rhythm, mood, and detail, and I like turning raw footage into something that feels intentional and polished.

### What I’m focused on
- Video editing & post-production
- Creative storytelling
- Clean, modern presentation of work
- Building a strong personal portfolio

### Tools & Interests
- Video editing workflows
- Motion, cuts, and sound design
- Creative projects & personal growth
- Learning new tools that improve quality and efficiency

### Currently
- Expanding my video editing portfolio  
- Sharing and organizing my work through GitHub  

Thanks for stopping by.
